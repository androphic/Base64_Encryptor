# Base64_Encryptor
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the Base64 algorithm in modern systems. Each attachment in an email, a textual representation of binary data in databases, is part of communication protocols. And all this is open to any hacker, to anyone who wants to intercept your messages and gain access to your documents, media files, applications and any other forms of binary data presented in text form. The goal of this project is to develop a variant of the Base64 algorithm that would allow data to be encrypted and decrypted during the encoding and decoding process. Without compromising performance and without increasing the memory required for encoding. The initial code will be developed in C, but as we work on the project we will add implementations in other languages with cross-testing to ensure unification of the algorithm implementation for different platforms and systems.
